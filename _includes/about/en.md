Hi, here is Towdium, a guy from Nanjing, China. I've got bacheler's degree in electrical enginering and electronics from Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University / University of Liverpool, and master's degree in computer science from University of Edinburgh. Feel free to contact me, I'm willing to talk and share.

Most of you might know me as a Minecraft modder, but I also creates industrial software (Qt+OpenGL) and did some research in deep learning (PyTorch). I'm also familiar with Docker, FGPA (Verilog) and Arduino. I was a long-term Linux desktop user (Manjaro Gnome), but I don't know much about Shell programming.

 For some less experienced skills, I have some understanding about power systems, analog circuits and control systems. Less related, I am skilled in multimedia content creation, including Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Inkscape and GIMP.

No intrest in food and travelling.
